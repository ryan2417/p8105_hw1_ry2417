## Problem 1

Create a data frame comprised of:  
a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution  
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 0  
a character vector of length 10  
a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”  

Using `tibble()` to create the date frame and naming the data frame as
`p1_df`.  

``` r
set.seed(1111)
p1_df <- 
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logic = vec_numeric > 0,
    vec_char = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
                 "nine", "ten"),
    vec_fac = factor(c(rep("rainy", 3), rep("sunny", 4), rep("snowy", 3)))
  )
```

Taking the mean of each variable in `p1_df`.  

``` r
mean_numeric <- mean(pull(p1_df, vec_numeric))
mean_logic <- mean(pull(p1_df, vec_logic))
mean_char <- mean(pull(p1_df, vec_char))
mean_fac <- mean(pull(p1_df, vec_fac))
```

The mean of numerical variable is 0.5 and the mean of logical variable
is 0.8. Taking means for character variable and factor variable do not
work.  

Convert the logical, character, and factor variables to numeric
variables.  

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p1_df, vec_logic))
as.numeric(pull(p1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(p1_df, vec_fac))
```

The factor variable and the logical variable can be converted to be
numeric, but the character variable cannot be converted. The logical
variable has only two outcomes, it was reasonable to convert 1 for TRUE
and 0 for FALSE. And the factor variable has three levels, so it is
reasonable to assign each level with nature number. However, for
character vector which contained many different words, it has no clue
for value that could be assigned to each element. This explained how
logical variable is taken mean.  

## Problem 2

Loading the `penguins` data set  

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Assigning the `penguins` data set to data frame of Problem 2 called
`p2_df`.  

``` r
p2_df <- as.tibble(penguins)
```

    ## Warning: `as.tibble()` was deprecated in tibble 2.0.0.
    ## Please use `as_tibble()` instead.
    ## The signature and semantics have changed, see `?as_tibble`.
    ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
    ## Call `lifecycle::last_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.

The size of this data set is 344 observations with 8 variables. The
variable names are
`species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year`.  
The max flipper length is 231 mm, the min is 172 mm, and the mean is
200.9 mm.  
The max bill length is 59.6 mm, the min is 32.1 mm and the mean is 43.9
mm.  
The max body mass is 6300 g and the min is 2700 g and the mean is 4201.8
g.  
The numbers of penguins of each specie are 152, 68, 124 (Adelie,
Chinstrap, Gentoo). The numbers of penguins from each island are 168,
124, 52 (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen).  
There are 165 females and 168 males.  

Make a scatter plot of `flipper_length_mm` (y) vs `bill_length_mm` (x);
color points using the `species` variable.  

``` r
ggplot(p2_df, aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                  y = flipper_length_mm, 
                  color = species)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```

![](p8105_hw1_ry2417_files/figure-gfm/bill_vs_flipper_scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

Export the first scatter plot to the project directory using `ggsave`.  

``` r
ggsave("bill_vs_flipper_scatterplot.pdf", height = 6, width = 8)
```
