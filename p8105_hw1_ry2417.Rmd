##Problem 1
Create a data frame comprised of:
a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution\
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0\
a character vector of length 10\
a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”\

Using `tibble()` to create the date frame and naming the data frame as `p1_df`.\
```{r}
p1_df <- 
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logic = vec_numeric > 0,
    vec_char = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
                 "nine", "ten"),
    vec_fac = factor(c(rep("rainy", 3), rep("sunny", 4), rep("snowy", 3)))
  )
```
